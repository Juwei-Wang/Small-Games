"""
Object-oriented programming

so far, we've been working with only basis types(int float bool str , list)
New goal, to use, create and design our own data type
gives us more powerful abstraction goals

ocp allows us to model both real-world and abstract entitles as objects

real-world entities
persom
vehicle
building
plant
DNA

abstract entities
number
relationship
companies
money


Data abstraction extends function abstraction

want to write code that also does data abstraction

whenever you can clealy separate data and associated tasks within a

computation you should do so.

using data types

all python datatype values are objects

to understand oop, we want to know about objects and methods(operations on objects)

a method is a function associated  with a specified objects

example.

you've been using <str>.split <str>.restrip <list>.append

even can int has methods

gg.bit_length



you don't need to know how a data type is implemented to be able to use it.

funtions and methods

to tell which is used ,look to the left of the.

s =" a,b,b"
s.split  s = variable name associated the object

import stddraw
stddraw.show()  stddraw = module_name

a = [1,2,3]
a.append(4)

from color(module) import Color(datatype)

turquire = my_color(64,224,209)
tamato = color (.....)
tomato_green = tomato.getgreen()
